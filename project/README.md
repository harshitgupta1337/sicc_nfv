# Project

You need to take the following steps to test your implementation.

1. `./step0_initialize_infra.sh`
2. `./step1_register.sh`
3. `./step2_launch.sh`
4. `./step3_scaleup.sh`

Finally you need to build a traffic generator that generates traffic between Docker containers based on the a profile of the format present in `traffic_profile.json`.
